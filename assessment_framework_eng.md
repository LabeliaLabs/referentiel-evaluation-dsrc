# Responsible and Trustworthy Data Science - Evaluation framework

The [evaluation framework](#evaluation-framework-to-assess-the-maturity-of-an-organisation) below is the result of the participatory work initiated in the spring of 2019 by Substra Foundation and ongoing since then. It is based on the identification of the risks that we are trying to prevent by aiming for a responsible and trustworthy practice of data science, and best practices to mitigate them. It also brings together for each topic technical resources that can be good entry points for interested organisations.

Last update: 1st semester 2021.

## Evaluation framework to assess the maturity of an organisation

The evaluation is composed of the following 6 sections:

- [Section 1 - Protecting personal or confidential data](#section-1---protecting-personal-or-confidential-data)
- [Section 2 - Preventing bias, developing non-discriminatory models](#section-2---preventing-bias-developing-non-discriminatory-models)
- [Section 3 - Assessing model performance rigorously](#section-3---assessing-model-performance-rigorously)
- [Section 4 - Ensuring model reproducibility and establishing the chain of accountability](#section-4---ensuring-model-reproducibility-and-establishing-the-chain-of-accountability)
- [Section 5 - Using models responsibly and in confidence](#section-5---using-models-responsibly-and-in-confidence)
- [Section 6 - Anticipating, monitoring and minimising the negative externalities of data science activities](#section-6---anticipating-monitoring-and-minimising-the-negative-externalities-of-data-science-activities)

---

### Section 1 - Protecting personal or confidential data

**[Data privacy]**

The use of personal or confidential data carries the risk of exposure of such data, which can have very detrimental consequences for the producers, controllers or subjects of such data. Particularly in data science projects, they must therefore be protected and the risks of their leakage or exposure must be minimised.

Q1.1 : **Applicable legislation and contractual requirements - Identification**  
With regard to personal or confidential data, the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements in force and concerning your organisation are:

R1.1 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 1.1.a Not yet identified
- [ ] 1.1.b Partially identified or in the process of identification
- [ ] 1.1.c Identified
- [ ] 1.1.d Identified and known by our collaborators
- [ ] 1.1.e Identified, documented and known by our collaborators

<details>
<summary>Expl1.1 :</summary>

It is crucial to put in place processes to know and follow the evolution of applicable regulations (very specific in certain fields, for example in the banking sector), as well as to document the approaches and choices made to comply with each data science project. Interesting example(s) : [Welfare surveillance system violates human rights, Dutch court rules](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules).

Q1.2 : **Applicable legislation and contractual requirements - Compliance approach**  
In order to meet these requirements, the approach adopted by your organisation is:

R1.2 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 1.2.a Informal, based on individual responsibility and competence
- [ ] 1.2.b Formalized and accessible to all collaborators
- [ ] 1.2.c Formalized and known by collaborators
- [ ] 1.2.d Formalized, known by employees, documented for each processing of personal or confidential data

<details>
<summary>Expl1.2 :</summary>

It is a question of questioning the management of personal or confidential data (storage, access, transfer, protection, responsibilities...), and documenting the choices made.

</details>

Q1.3 : **Applicable legislation and contractual requirements - Regulatory surveillance**  
Is a regulatory surveillance process in place, either internally or via a specialised service provider, to find out about applicable changes that have an impact on your organisation?

R1.3 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 1.3.a We do not really monitor the regulatory environment
- [ ] 1.3.b We keep an informal watch, each employee sends back information via internal communication channels
- [ ] 1.3.c We have a formal surveillance, with identified collaborators in charge and a documented process

<details>
<summary>Expl1.3 :</summary>

In addition to identifying regulations and compliance approaches, it is important to set up a surveillance processe to know and follow **the evolution** of applicable regulations (which can be very specific in certain sectors). Interesting example(s) : [Welfare surveillance system violates human rights, Dutch court rules](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules).

</details>

Q1.4 : **Applicable legislation and contractual requirements - Auditing and certification**  
Has the organisation's compliance with personal and confidential data requirements been audited and is it recognised by a certification, label or equivalent?

R1.4 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 1.4.a Yes
- [ ] 1.4.b No
- [ ] 1.4.c We are currently preparing an upcoming audit or certification of our organisation's compliance with personal and confidential data requirements
- [ ] 1.4.d Not at the organization level, but it is the case for at least one project

<details>
<summary>Expl1.4 :</summary>

In many sectors there are specific compliance requirements. It is generally possible to formalise an organisation's compliance through certification or a specialised audit, or by obtaining a label.

</details>

Q1.5 : **Data minimisation principle**  
In data science projects, the data minimisation principle should guide the collection and use of personal or confidential data. How is it implemented in your organisation?

R1.5 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_  
_(Specific risk domain: use of personal or confidential data)_

- [ ] 1.5.a We take care not to use any personal or confidential data. We are not concerned by this risk area
- [ ] 1.5.b We need to use personal or confidential data in certain projects and the data minimisation principle is then systematically applied
- [ ] 1.5.c Employees are aware of the data minimisation principle and generally apply it
- [ ] 1.5.d The "who can do the most can do the least" reflex with regard to data still exists here and there within our organisation. In some projects, we keep datasets that are much richer in personal and confidential data than what is strictly useful to the project
- [ ] 1.5.e Employees are aware of the data minimisation principle, but it is not applied as a general standard. However, we give a particular attention to implementing personal data-related risk mitigation measures (i.e. pseudonymising some features by identifiers with a separate correspondence table, split datasets in multiple tables kept apart)

<details>
<summary>Expl1.5 :</summary>

The data minimisation principle is sometimes also referred to as "privacy by design". It is one of the pillars of the RGPD in the European Union.

Q1.6 : **Project involving new processing of personal or confidential data**  
_(Condition: R1.5 <> 1.5.a)_  
For each processing of personal or confidential data required in the framework of a data science project within your organisation:

R1.6 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all the answer items that correspond to practices in your organisation)_

- [ ] 1.6.a We elaborate a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- [ ] 1.6.b We implement data protection measures (in particular concerning the transfer, storage and access to the data concerned)
- [ ] 1.6.c We contractualise relations with suppliers and customers and the responsibilities that arise from them
- [ ] 1.6.d We have not yet set up an organised approach to these subjects

<details>
<summary>Expl1.6 :</summary>

The *Privacy Impact Assessment* (PIA) is a method for assessing the impact of a data processing, similar to traditional risk assessment methods. In certain cases, for example where a processing operation presents high risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the GDPR makes it obligatory to carry out an PIA before the processing operation is carried out.

Q1.7 : **Machine Learning security - Knowledge level**  
_(Condition: R1.5 <> 1.5.a)_  
Machine Learning security (_ML security_) is a constantly evolving field. In some cases, predictive models learned from confidential data may reveal elements of that confidential data (see articles cited in resources). Within your organisation, the general level of knowledge of collaborators working on data science projects about vulnerabilities related to ML models and the techniques to mitigate them is:

R1.7 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 1.7.a Complete beginner
- [ ] 1.7.b Basic
- [ ] 1.7.c Confirmed
- [ ] 1.7.d Expert

<details>
<summary>Expl1.7 :</summary>

The state of the art in ML security is constantly evolving. If data scientists are now familiar in general with the membership inference attack (see proposed resources), new ones are being published regularly. While it is impossible to guard against all vulnerabilities at all times, it is crucial to be aware of them and to keep a watch on them. The article [Demystifying the Membership Inference Attack](https://medium.com/disaitek/demystifying-the-membership-inference-attack-e33e510a0c39) is for example an interesting entry point in the context of sensitive data.

### Section 2 - Preventing bias, developing non-discriminatory models

**[Biases and discrimination]**

The use of predictive models learned from historical data can be counterproductive when historical data are contaminated by problematic phenomena (e.g. quality of certain data points, non-comparable data, social phenomena undesirable due to the time period, etc.). A key challenge for responsible and trustworthy data science is to respect the principle of diversity, non-discrimination and equity (described for example in section 1.5 of the EU [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=60419)). It is therefore essential to question this risk and to study the nature of the data used, the conditions under which they were produced and collected, and what they represent.
Among other things, in some cases a specification of the equity sought between populations must also be defined. The equity of a model can [be defined in several ways that may be inconsistent with each other](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6995-counterfactual-fairness), and the interpretation of performance scores must therefore be made within the framework of one of these definitions.

Q2.1 : **Analysis of the training data**  
Within data science projects and when developing training datasets, reflection and research on problematic phenomena (e.g. quality of certain data points, data that are not comparable due to recording tools or processes, social phenomena that are undesirable due to time, context, etc.) can be crucial to prevent bias that undermines the principle of non-discrimination, diversity and equity. Your organisation:

Q2.3 : **Preventing discriminatory bias**  
_(Condition: R2.2 <> 2.2.b)_

R2.3 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_

- [ ] 2.3.c We select and implement one or more justice and equity measure(s) (_fairness metrics_)
- [ ] 2.3.d We use _data augmentation_ or _re-weighting_ approaches to reduce possible biases in the data sets
- [ ] 2.3.e The above practices that we implement are duly documented and integrated into the end-to-end genealogy of the models concerned
- [ ] 2.3.f We have not yet put in place any such measures

<details>
<summary>Expl2.3 :</summary>

It is a question of systematically questioning, for each data science project and according to the objective and target use of the model that one wants to develop, the features that may directly or indirectly be the source of a risk of discriminatory bias. The term "protected attribute" or "protected variable" is used to refer to attributes whose values define sub-populations at risk of discrimination.
Complement on the use of synthetic data and _data augmentation_, _re-weighting_ approaches in order to reduce possible biases in the data sets: when such techniques are used it is important to make them explicit, otherwise there is a risk of losing information on how a model was developed.

Q2.4 : **Links between modelisation choices and bias**  
_(Condition : R2.2 <> 2.2.b)_  
Recent work has shown the role that modeling and learning choices can play in the formation of discriminatory bias. Differential privacy, compression, the choice of the learning rate, early stopping mechanisms for example can have disproportionate impacts on certain subgroups. Within your organisation, the general level of knowledge of collaborators working on data science projects on this topic is:

R2.4 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 2.4.b Basic
- [ ] 2.4.c Confirmed
- [ ] 2.4.d Expert

<details>
<summary>Expl2.4 :</summary>

If datasets used to train and evaluate a model require a particular attention to prevent discriminatory biases, recent work show that modeling choices have to be taken into account too. The article *"Moving beyond “algorithmic bias is a data problem”"* suggested in resources synthesizes very well how the learning algorithm, the model structure, adding or not differential privacy, compression, etc. can have consequences on the fairness of a model. Extracts:

> - *A key reason why model design choices amplify algorithmic bias is because notions of fairness often coincide with how underrepresented protected features are treated by the model*
> - [...] *design choices to optimize for either privacy guarantees or compression amplify the disparate impact between minority and majority data subgroups*

> - [...] *learning rate and length of training can also disproportionately impact error rates on the long-tail of the dataset.

These topics require a strong expertise and few practitioners are familiar with them yet. In the context of this evaluation element, the recommendation is to learn about them and become aware of the complex trade-offs it implies, consider them during concrete projects rather than hiding them away, and follow how the state-of-the-art evolves and what best practices emerge.

### Section 3 - Assessing model performance rigorously

**[Performance evaluation]**

The performance of the models is crucial for their adoption in products, systems or processes. Performance evaluation must therefore be rigorous.

[_[⇧ back to the list of sections](#evaluation-framework-to-assess-the-maturity-of-an-organisation)_]  
[_[⇩ next section](#section-4---ensuring-model-reproducibility-and-establishing-the-chain-of-accountability)_]

Q3.1 : **Separation of test datasets**  
In data science projects and when developing test datasets, it is of utmost importance to ensure non-contamination by training data. Your organisation:

R3.1 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all response items that correspond to practices in your organisation. Please note that some combinations would not be coherent)_

- [ ] 3.1.a Operates informally on this subject and relies on the competence and responsibility of the collaborators involved
- [ ] 3.1.b Has a documented and systematically implemented approach to isolating test datasets
- [ ] 3.1.c Uses a tool for versioning and tracing the training and test datasets used, thus enabling the non-contamination of test data to be checked or audited at a later stage
- [ ] 3.1.d Systematically plans two or more sets of test data to increase resilience

<details>
<summary>Expl3.1 :</summary>

Ensuring that training and test datasets are kept separated is a principle known and mastered by most organisations. It can however be tricky in some particular configurations (e.g. continuous learning, distributed learning *privacy-preserving*...).

</details>

---

Q3.2 : **Privacy-preserving distributed learning projects**  
In the case of data science projects based on distributed or federated learning on multiple datasets and whose confidentiality must be preserved:

R3.2 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_  
_(Specific risk domain: federated leraning on sensitive data)_

- [ ] 3.2.a We do not participate in *privacy-preserving* distributed learning projects | _(Concerned / Not concerned)_
- [ ] 3.2.b We master and implement approaches to develop test datasets in such a way that there is no cross-contamination between training and test data from different partners
- [ ] 3.2.c At this stage we do not master the methods for developing test datasets in such a way that there is no cross-contamination between training and test data from the different partners

<details>
<summary>Expl3.2 :</summary>

In this type of distributed learning project under conditions where the data is kept confidential, the question arises of how to compose a test dataset, making sure that it does not also appear in the training dataset (e.g. at another partner's premises).

Q3.3 : **Analysis of validation and test data**  
Within data science projects and when developing validation or test datasets, reflection and research on problematic phenomena (e.g. quality of certain data points, data that are not comparable due to recording tools or processes, social phenomena that are undesirable due to time, context, etc.) can be crucial for the meaning of performance scores. Your organisation:

R3.3 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 3.3.a Operates informally on this subject and relies on the practice of each collaborator member involved
- [ ] 3.3.b Does not have a documented approach to the subject, but the collaborators involved are trained on the risks and best practices on the subject
- [ ] 3.3.c Has a documented approach that is systematically implemented

<details>
<summary>Expl3.3 :</summary>

The use of predictive models that have been validated and tested on historical data can be counterproductive when the historical data in question is contaminated by problematic phenomena. It seems essential to question this risk and to study the nature of the data used, the conditions under which they were produced and assembled, and what they represent.

</details>

Q3.4 : **Performance validation**  
Does your organisation implement the following approaches:

R3.4 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all the answer items that correspond to practices in your organisation)_

- [ ] 3.4.a When developing a model, we choose the performance metric(s) prior to actually training the model, from among the most standard metrics possible
- [ ] 3.4.b The implementation of robustness metrics is considered and evaluated for each modelling project, and applied by default in cases where the input data may be subject to fine-grain alterations (e.g. images, sounds)
- [ ] 3.4.c The above practices that we implement are documented and integrated into the end-to-end genealogy of the models concerned, including the performance metrics chosen
- [ ] 3.4.d We have not yet introduced any such measures

<details>
<summary>Expl3.4 :</summary>

On choosing metrics upstream, see for example the risk of *[p-hacking / data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging)*.
On robustness, an intuitive definition is that a model is robust when its performance is stable when the input data is disturbed. For more information see the technical resources indicated.

Q3.5 : **Monitoring model performance over time**  
In cases where predictive models developed by your organisation are used in production systems:

R3.5 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all response items that correspond to practices in your organisation. Please note that some combinations would not be coherent)_  
_(Specific risk domain: use of predictive models in production systems)_

- [ ] 3.5.a The models we develop are not used in production systems | _(Concerned / Not concerned)_
- [ ] 3.5.b Performance is systematically re-evaluated when the model is updated
- [ ] 3.5.c Performance is systematically re-evaluated when the context in which the model is used evolves, which may create a risk on the performance of the model due to the evolution of the input data space
- [ ] 3.5.d The distribution of input data is monitored, and performance is regularly re-evaluated on the basis of updated test data
- [ ] 3.5.e Random checks are carried out on predictions to check their consistency
- [ ] 3.5.f We do not systematically set up this type of measure

<details>
<summary>Expl3.5 :</summary>

Even on a stable model, there is a risk that the input data will no longer remain in the target distribution after a certain time (population & distribution), for example, a variable that would no longer be filled in at the same frequency as before by users in an IS. It is therefore necessary to regularly re-evaluate the performance of a model used in its context of use.
Monitoring the performance of models over time is also particularly important in cases of continuous learning, where there is a risk of model degeneration.

Q3.6 : **Decision making and ranges of indecision**  
For the definition of decision thresholds for models or automatic systems based on them, your organisation:

R3.6 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all response items that correspond to practices in your organisation. Please note that some combinations would not be coherent)_

Q3.7 : **Audits by independent third parties and *verifiable claims***

- [ ] 3.7.b We communicate on our results and rely on them for our development without first having our work audited by an independent third party, without making evidence available
- [ ] 3.7.c We have our work audited by an independent third party, or we make evidence available, before communicating our results and using them to communicate and rely on with our stakeholders

<details>
<summary>Expl3.7 :</summary>

Developing a predictive model, and determining a meaningful and reliable benchmark performance measure, is a complex challenge. It is therefore often difficult for an organisation to assert that it has achieved excellent results and to claim them with certainty. Where possible, however, it may be even more difficult to make evidence publicly available without revealing valuable information about the organisation's intellectual property and the value of the work carried out. In such cases, it is recommended to have an audit carried out by an independent third party (e.g. security, privacy, fairness, reliability...), in order to secure the results the organisation wishes to claim.

### Section 4 - Ensuring model reproducibility and establishing the chain of accountability

**[Model documentation]**

A predictive model is a complex object that can evolve over time. Tracing the stages of its development and evolution allows one to create a form of **genealogy**, which is a prerequisite for **reproducing or auditing** a model. Furthermore, using automatic systems based on models whose rules have been "learned" (and not defined and formalised) questions the way organisations operate. It seems essential to guarantee a clear chain of responsibility, of natural or legal persons, for each model.

Q4.1 : **"End-to-end genealogy" of ML models**  
Ensuring the traceability of all steps of the development of a predictive model enables building up a form of **genealogy**. Within your organisation, an end-to-end genealogy of models is fed and maintained within the framework of data science projects, throughout the phases of data collection, design, training, validation and exploitation of the predictive models:

R4.1 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 4.1.a At this stage we have not implemented any such approach
- [ ] 4.1.b This information exists and is recorded so as not to be lost, but it may be scattered and it is not versioned
- [ ] 4.1.c They are compiled in a single document which systematically accompanies the model
- [ ] 4.1.d They are gathered in a single document that systematically accompanies the model and is versioned

<details>
<summary>Expl4.1 :</summary>

This concept of the "end-to-end genealogy" of a learned predictive model can take the form, for example, of a reference document containing all the important choices and the entire history of model development (data used, pre-processing carried out, type of learning and model architecture, hyperparameters selected, decision thresholds, test metrics, etc.), and the internal processes organising this activity. In particular, it is interesting to include the trade-offs that have been made and why (e.g. trade-offs precision-specification, performance-privacy, performance-computing cost, etc.).

Q4.2 : **Conditions and limitations for using a model**  
In the context of data science projects, the "conditions and limits of validity" of a model designed, trained and validated by the organisation:

R4.2 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all response items that correspond to practices in your organisation. Please note that some combinations would not be coherent)_

- [ ] 4.2.e The documents presenting these "conditions and limits of validity" systematically accompany the models throughout their life cycle

<details>
<summary>Expl4.2 :</summary>

The aim is to make explicit and add to the model the description of the context of use for which it was designed and in which its announced performance is significant. This concept of "conditions and limits of validity" can take the form of a synthetic document or a specific section in the "end-to-end genealogy".

Q4.5 : **Subcontracting of all or part of the data science activities**  
Data science activities subcontracted to a third party organisation(s) are subject to the same requirements your organisation applies to itself:

- [ ] 4.5.c No, our answers to this evaluation do not apply to our subcontractors and on certain points they may be less advanced than us

<details>
<summary>Expl4.5 :</summary>

As in the reference frameworks of IS management (ISO 27001) or GDPR in the European Union, it is important not to dilute responsibilities in uncontrolled subcontracting chains. This should apply, for example, to consultants, freelancers who come to reinforce an internal team on a data science project. For example, it is possible to ask sub-contractors to carry out the same evaluation on their own account and share their results with you.

Q4.6 : **Distribution of the value creation**

- [ ] 4.6.a Our organisation carries out its data science activities autonomously, including the development of datasets and the exploitation of models for its own account. It is therefore not concerned | _(Concerned / Not concerned)_
- [ ] 4.6.b At this stage we have not structured this aspect of multi-partner data science projects
- [ ] 4.6.c In these cases, we contract the economic aspect of the relationship with the stakeholders involved upstream of the project
- [ ] 4.6.d Our organisation has a policy that responsibly frames the sharing of value with the stakeholders involved

<details>
<summary>Expl4.6 :</summary>

When several partners work together to develop a model, it is important that the distribution of value resulting from an economic activity in which the model plays a role is made explicit and contractualized.

### Section 5 - Using models responsibly and in confidence

**[Using the models]**

A predictive model can be used as an automatic system, whose rules or criteria are not written _in extenso_ and are difficult to explain, discuss or adjust. Using automatic systems based on predictive models whose rules have been "learned" (and not defined and formalised) therefore questions the way organisations design and operate their products and services. It is important to preserve the responsiveness and resilience of organisations using those predictive models, particularly in dealing with situations where predictive models have led to an undesirable outcome for the organisation or its stakeholders. In addition, efforts are therefore needed on the interpretation and explanation of the choices made using these systems.

Using automatic systems based on models whose rules have been "learned" (and not defined and formalised) questions the way organisations design and operate their products and services. It is important to assess the consequences and reactions in the event of an incident. Furthermore, it is important that persons in charge is clearly identified so that no stakeholder is left helpless in the face of an unexpected or inappropriate consequence. Finally, it is important to consider the "conditions and limits of validity" of the models used to ensure that the intended use is appropriate.

Using automatic systems based on models whose rules have been "learned" (and not defined and formalised) questions the way organisations design and operate their products and services. It is important to assess the consequences and reactions in the event of an incident. Furthermore, it is important that persons in charge is clearly identified so that no stakeholder is left helpless in the face of an unexpected or inappropriate consequence. Finally, it is important to consider the "conditions and limits of validity" of the models used to ensure that the intended use is appropriate.

Q5.3 : **Management of problematic predictions, bypass process, _human agency_**  
Automatic systems, especially when based on learned predictive models, are used in production generally to gain efficiency. By nature, they occasionally generate undesirable results for the organisation and its stakeholders (e.g. wrong prediction), as they will never achieve 100% performance.

### Section 6 - Anticipating, monitoring and minimising the negative externalities of data science activities

**[Negative externalities]**

The implementation of an automatic system based on a predictive model can generate negative social and environmental externalities. Awareness of this is essential, as well as anticipating, monitoring and minimising the various negative impacts.

Q6.2 : **Social impact**
In some cases, the implementation of an automatic system based on a predictive model can generate negative externalities on upstream stakeholders (e.g. annotation of data), and on downstream stakeholders (e.g. automation of certain positions). Whenever you plan to develop or use a predictive model, your organisation:

R6.2 :  
_(Type: single answer)_  
_(Select one answer only, which best corresponds to the level of maturity of the organisation on this topic)_

- [ ] 6.2.a At this stage we are not looking at the social impact of our data science activity or our predictive models
- [ ] 6.2.b In some cases we study the social impact
- [ ] 6.2.c We study the social impact in each project
- [ ] 6.2.d We study the social impact in each project and it is documented in the end-to-end genealogy of each model
- [ ] 6.2.e We study the social impact in each project, it is documented in the end-to-end genealogy of each model, and we systematically engage in a dialogue with the relevant stakeholders upstream and downstream the value chain.

<details>
<summary>Expl6.2 :</summary>

It is important for an organisation to question and exchange with its stakeholders. This applies both downstream (e.g. automation of certain jobs) and upstream (e.g. data annotation tasks that can be very violent) the value chain.

Q6.3 : **Ethics and non-maleficence**  
Within your organisation:

R6.3 :  
_(Type: multiple responses possible)_  
_(Select all response items that correspond to practices in your organisation. Please note that some combinations would not be coherent)_

- [ ] 6.3.a At this stage we have not yet addressed the ethical dimension of our data science projects
- [ ] 6.3.b Employees involved in data science activities receive training in ethics
- [ ] 6.3.c Our organisation has adopted an ethics policy
- [ ] 6.3.d For projects justifying it, we set up an independent ethics committee or ask for the evaluation of an organisation validating the ethics of the projects

<details>
<summary>Expl6.3 :</summary>

Working with large volumes of data, some of which may be sensitive, using automatic systems based on models whose rules have been "learned" (and not defined and formalised) raises questions about the way organisations function and the individual responsibility of each contributor. It requires considering carefully the uses of such sytems. It is therefore important for the organisation to ensure that ethical issues are not unknown to its collaborators.
A recurring example is that some AI systems or services designed to adapt to user behaviour may influence users (e.g. by seeking to maximise their time of use or the money they spend) and present significant risks of manipulation or addiction.
